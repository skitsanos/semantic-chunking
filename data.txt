The Light Weight Payload Delivery System (LWPD) will consist of a fleet of drones, each equipped with sensors to
detect obstacles in their path, communication modules to communicate with other drones in the squad and a payload
delivery mechanism. The drones will be able to navigate through flooded areas using GPS data and will communicate
with a gateway drone or coordinator drone, which will provide them with information about the location of the
payload and any obstacles in their path.

The LWPD system will be designed to operate autonomously, but it will also have a human operator who can monitor
the drones' progress and intervene if necessary. The drones will be equipped with sensors such as an ultrasonic
sensor that detects objects in their path, a camera for obstacle avoidance, and GPS to determine their location.

The communication modules used by the drones will be ESP32 dual-core modules running FreeRTOS and ESP-NOW
protocol. The ESP-NOW protocol will allow the drones to communicate with each other in real-time, while FreeRTOS
will provide a high-level operating system for the drone.

The payload delivery mechanism will consist of a small container that can hold up to 1kg of supplies such as food,
medical equipment, and water purification tablets. The container will be dropped by the drone using a parachute or
other delivery method depending on the situation.

To ensure compliance with local and international laws regarding drone flights, the LWPD system will have a
built-in safety mechanism that automatically disengages the payload delivery mechanism if it senses an obstacle in
its path. The drones will also be equipped with a return-to-home feature that automatically returns the drone to
its takeoff point if communication is lost or the battery runs low.

Overall, the LWPD system is designed to deliver humanitarian aid quickly and efficiently in flooded areas while
complying with local and international laws regarding drone flights.

>>> We were requested to provide project documentation. Let's outline the sections of it and later we will detail each s
... eparately.
